 8/20 AAT Refreshing the basins based on latest versions.
 8/20 AAT Adding a -incEnv option to allow one to probe the envelope frame
          as well as others.  Date stamp on envelope frame is 4/20/2009 22:40Z

 7/14 AAT Refreshing the basins based on latest versions.

#
10/30 AAT Updated rexout so it can correctly find the "envelope" frame if that
          is the first frame (ie no animation frames).  Also put in extra
          safety checks around the time value to try to detect corrupt rexfiles
10/30 AAT Enhanced the speed of windProbe by using static variables to reduce
          the number of calls to force1.  This should be an order of magnitude
          faster
10/30 AAT Updated the libaat library, and corrected the call to ListSearch by 
          remembering to divide by the sizeof (UsrOpt[0])

 8/7  AAT Realized that the release system was not packing the libaat source

 9/12 AAT Did some more testing of the wind speed calculations.  The slosh
          display appears to use the point clicked on for the lat/lon rather
          than the center of the box.  This causes slight discrepancies of
          "station" wind speed.
 8/29 AAT Finished up initial NIST edits and options.
 8/25 AAT Opened up "rexout.tar.gz" for serious development
          (for NIST purposes).
7/13/2006 Started looking at rexout (for hurrevac meetings).
